\title{Benchmark File Reading with Optional Memory Mapping}
\usage{
bench_read(file, chunk_size = NULL, mmap = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{chunk_size}{Integer. Number of FASTQ records to accumulate before
dispatching a chunk to worker threads for processing. This controls the
granularity of parallel work and affects memory usage and performance.
Default is \code{256}.}
}
\description{
This function benchmarks the reading performance of a file by processing it
in chunks. It allows for optional memory-mapped file access, which can
improve performance in multi-threaded environments by reducing memory
copying.
