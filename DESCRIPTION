Description: An integrated framework for high-resolution microbiome analysis in
    single-cell sequencing. Leveraging Kraken2 for initial taxonomic
    classification, the package performs barcode-aware filtering and
    reconstructs read-level information by integrating cell barcodes and UMIs.
    It quantifies k-mers and aggregates taxon-specific signals across multiple
    taxonomic ranks. This enables accurate reconstruction and quantitative
    profiling of microbial communities at single-cell resolution.
